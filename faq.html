                  <p>Nope! You can build whatever you would like with whatever tools you want. We will have some awesome prize categories though.</p>
        
                  <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
                  <p>The hackathon is open to everyone!</p>
        
                  <h2>Who is eligible for prizes?</h2>
                  <p>Everyone except sponsors and judges (to keep it fair).</p>
        
                  <h2>Are there any rules?</h2>
                  <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>No code can be written until the event kicks off.</li>
                    <li>No finishing previously started projects.</li>
                    <li>Libraries and frameworks are allowed.</li>
                    <li>All participants abide by the code of conduct.</li>
                  </ul>
        
                  <h2>I have an idea! How do I share?</h2>
                  <p>Youâ€™ll have a chance to share it the day of the event.</p>
        
                  <h2>How do I present my project?</h2>
                  <p>Everyone will have the opportunity to showcase their projects on Sunday during our closing ceremony / project presentations.</p>
        
                  <h2>How do I join a team?</h2>
                  <p>Talk with people about their ideas and find which interests you the most! We expect the teams to form organically</p>
        
                  <h2>Can I be on more than one team?</h2>
                  <p>Yes, but you will only be eligible for one prize.</p>
        
                  <h2>Do I have to attend the full 24 hours?</h2>
                  <p>We recommend you stay for a majority of the time and encourage you to participate as much as you can.</p>
        
                  <h2>How many people per team?</h2>
                  <p>No team limit! However, if it's a themed prize, not everyone on the team will get a prize. We recommend a max of 5 people per team (front-end, back-end, designer/ UX, dev-ops, data).</p>

                  <h2>Will I annoy people if I ask them questions?</h2>
                  <p>No, you will not! This is a huge misconception, it's actually quite the opposite. If you're ever stuck on something, go find a mentor, volunteer, or organizer who can help. Or, seriously anyone at the event. We'd be willing to bet they will help you!</p>
        
                  <h2>What if I donâ€™t know anybody there?</h2>
                  <p>That's totally fine. You'll meet people at the event, everyone is super friendly. Lot's of poeple go to our event wihtout teams, so it's normal to ask around if you're looking for a team or if you can help out.</p>

                  <h2>What if I donâ€™t want to present my hack?</h2>
                  <p>Even if your project is not finished or you don't want to present, we encourage you to anyway. Hackathons aren't about being the best or being competitive. It's about having fun, making friends, learning new things, and celebrating technology. Presenting gives you a chance to be proud of what you've created!</p>

                  <h2>Do I need to bring anything?</h2>
        
                  <p>At a minimum, you will need:
                    <ul class="mb-3">
                      <li>laptop / computer</li>
                      <li>charger / power cords</li>
                      <li>eagerness to build something awesome</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    We also recommend:
                    <ul class="mb-3">

                      <li>toiletries</li>

                  <h2>Can I use hardware?</h2>
                  <p>Of course! Raspberry pis, arduino boards, oculus rifts, etc. are all welcome.</p>
        
                  <h2>Will there be hardware / equipment for me to borrow?</h2>
                  <p>Yes! We have tons of awesome hardware in our lab for you to borrow. We also have:
        
                    <ul class="mb-3">
                      <li>10 HDMI cables</li>

                  <h2>Are laptops provided?</h2>
                  <p>We will have two laptops provided for you to borrow (but, they are pretty old).</p>
        
                  <h2>Can I come to hang out rather than participate?</h2>
                  <p>Yes, if you would like to just stop by to hang out and learn about the hackathon you are more than welcome to.
                    We encourage you to participate.</p>
        
                  <h2>Can I sleep at the event?</h2>
                  <p>If you donâ€™t mind uncomfortable sleeping spots, sure. Bring a sleeping bag and pillow if you'd like. If you can
                    stay up for all 24 hours though, you are indeed a trooper.</p>
        
                  <h2>Will there be travel reimbursement?</h2>
                  <p>We are not offering reimbursement for travel at the moment, sorry.</p>
        
                  <h2>I'm not a developer / I don't know how to code / I donâ€™t think I know enough to participate.</h2>

                  <p>Not a problem! Itâ€™s entirely irrelevant what your experience is going into a hackathon, itâ€™s more about your interest in technology. 
                    There will be a way for you to make an impact, we're certain of it.
                    We make our hackathons very welcoming and beginner-friendly through mentors at the event and our amazing community that is happy to help new folks.
                    If you want to dive into code or sharpen your skills, check out Treehouse, Codecademy, or FreeCodeCamp. 
                   </p>

                  <h2>Who â€˜ownsâ€™ the projects and intellectual property produced during the event?</h2>
                  <p>The teams themselves 'own' the projects and intellectual property. We wouldn't have it any other way. </p>
        
                  <h2>What happens to the projects following the hackathon? How often do teams stay together and further develop a project?</h2>
                  <p>Projects will be on Devpost, and we'll post winners to our website. If teams have loose ends to tie up they might meet to finish the project - it really depends on their availability. We encourage teams to keep on hacking even after the event is over!</p>
        
                  <h2>Do you submit a project idea prior to the event?</h2>
                  <p>You can try find a team using devpost or pitching your idea in Slack, but you can decide at any point during the event what you'd like to work on.</p>
        
                  <h2>Are you a MLH (Major League Hacking) event?</h2>
                  <p>We are not. We're a student / practitioner hackathon, run by non-students. We love MLH though!</p>
        
                  <h2>I still have a question! Who do I contact?</h2>
                  <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:team@hackupstate.com">team@hackupstate.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

                <p>Yes we are!</p>

                <h2>Can sponsors participate in the hackathon? Are they eligibile for prizes?</h2>
                <p>Yes, sponsors can participate. No, they are not eligibile for prizes to keep it fair. However, other members on the team are eligible for prizes.</p>

                <h2>What is a sponsor's time commitment?</h2>
                <p>As long as you are able! Peak hours for exposure are before and after the opening ceremony on Saturday.</p>

                <h2>Will sponsors have travel reimbursement?</h2>
                <p>No, sorry!</p>

              <div class="tab-pane container fade" id="judge">
                <h2>What is a judge's time commitment?</h2>
                <p>The commitment would involve joining us between 11:30am - 2pm Sunday for demos and the judging portion. The judge is, of course, welcome to join us at the event for as long as they are able.</p>

                <h2>How technical should the technical judge be?</h2>
                <p>The judges get a rubric to score projects. Hackers will submit source code, but judges wonâ€™t need to review it.</p>

                <h2>Can a judge participate?</h2>
                <p>Judges can participate and demo, but that team wouldn't be in the runnings for prizes. The judge would have to make it evident to folks ahead of time when they pitch during the opening ceremony.</p>

                <h2>Will judges have travel reimbursement?</h2>
                <p>No, sorry!</p>
